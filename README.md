# LogFileCleaner
PowerShell repo that scans explicit log directories and removes files past the directories max days date. Using this to get my head around PowerShell mainly! Feel free to make any suggestions, would strongly prefer to know.

What I learned:
- How to log stdout of my scripts
- How to import files in PS
- How to find files within folders
- Changing types of variables and constraining them

Next, I need to implement more type validation and error handling.
